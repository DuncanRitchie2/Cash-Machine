# Java cash machine
🏧 A very simple console simulation of a cash machine in Java, made in August 2019 when I was just starting to learn Java.

💰 To run this, you will need to be able to run Java from source.

💷 This used to be in my [java-day-1](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/java-day-1/) repo, and was committed in [the first commit](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/java-day-1/commit/3615ac37e8731eb0442d78f067f3b51a002482e7) in that repo.

🏦 There is also a JavaScript version, from January 2019, when I was just starting to learn JavaScript: https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/jsChallenges
